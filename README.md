## Course Aims

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving process with the aid of computer; i.e. formulating a
problem and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It
includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered
steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented
as algorithms running on computer. As such, computational thinking is essential not only to the
Computer Science discipline, it can also be used to support problem solving across all disciplines,
including math, science, engineering, business, finance and humanities.

The aim of this course is hence to take you especially students with no prior experience of thinking in a
computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to
solve some basic problems in their domain of studies. In addition, the course will include topics to
appreciate the internal operations of a processor, and raise awareness of the socio-ethical issues
arising from the pervasiveness of computing technology.
